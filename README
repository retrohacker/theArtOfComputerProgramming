This is a repository that I will be using to organize all of the code I write while working through the book "The Art of Computer Programming" by Donald Knuth. The filesystem is organized in the following manner:

Algorithm1/
|-programmingLanguage1/
| |-SupportingFiles
|-programmingLanguage2/
  |-SupportingFiles
Algorithm2/
|-programmingLangauge1/
| |-SupportingFiles
|-programmingLanguage2/
